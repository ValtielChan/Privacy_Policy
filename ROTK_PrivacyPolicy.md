### 2. No Internet Connectivity

The Game is **fully offline**. It does not connect to the internet, to external servers, or to any cloud‑based services during gameplay or at any other time.

### 3. Information We Do **Not** Collect

Because the Game runs entirely on your headset without network access, we **do not collect, store, or transmit**:

### 4. Permissions We Do **Not** Request

The Game requests **zero optional permissions**. It operates with only the basic runtime permissions automatically granted by the META Quest operating system and requires no access to:

* Microphone or camera
* Contacts
* Motion controller data beyond standard system processing
* Storage outside the app’s own sandbox

### 5. Third‑Party Services

The Game integrates **no third‑party SDKs, plug‑ins, or analytics tools**. Consequently, no data is shared with external parties, advertising networks, or social platforms.

### 6. Children’s Privacy

The Game is rated for general audiences and collects no data from any player, including children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please note that we have no mechanism to receive such information.

### 7. Security

Although we do not process personal data, we follow industry‑standard practices to keep the Game’s local files secure and free of malicious code. All gameplay logic runs entirely on‑device.

### 8. Changes to This Policy

Because we do not collect data, changes are unlikely. However, if the Game is updated to include online features or data processing in the future, we will:

1. Publish an updated Privacy Policy at least 30 days before the change takes effect, and
2. Prominently notify users through the META Quest Store listing and in‑app notice.
